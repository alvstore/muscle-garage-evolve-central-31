## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Supabase account and project
- (Optional) Hikvision/eSSL devices for access control

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd muscle-garage-crm
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Environment Setup**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Payment Integration (Optional)
VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key

# Access Control (Optional)
VITE_HIKVISION_API_URL=your_hikvision_api_url
```

4. **Database Setup**
The Supabase database schema is automatically synced. Key tables include:
- `profiles` - User profiles and roles
- `branches` - Multi-branch support
- `members` - Gym member data
- `trainers` - Trainer profiles and specializations
- `classes` - Class scheduling
- `invoices` - Billing and payments
